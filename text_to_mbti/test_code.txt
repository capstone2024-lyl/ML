What d'you mean by leaving the baby? Don't you hear him howling! Running about the streets is all you know. I'll give it you. Good - day, sir. Children are a trouble! I'm quite done up, everything on my shoulders, and now they're taking our only worker to prison, and this lout is sprawling about here. He's ill, and what about me? Am I not ill? When it's work, he's ill; but to merry - make or pull my hair out, he's not too ill. Let him die like a hound! What do I care? I know it's a sin; but I can't subdue my heart. I'm expecting another child, and I have to work for two. Other people have their harvest in already, and we have not mowed a quarter of our oats yet. I ought to finish binding the sheaves, but can't. I had to come and see what the children were about. Oh, binding's nothing. I can do that myself, if it's only mown down quick. What d'you think, Nicholas Ivánovich, will he die? He is very ill! Oh God! Don't take him away, let him die here. What's the matter? The woman, for all her roughness, is sorry to part from her husband. Well, I don't know. I've lost my head. Maláshka, get dinner ready. What? Why, potatoes and bread, and not enough of that.
